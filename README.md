# Software Development with UML and Java
My exercises/notes by following SDJ Java course

# Purpose of the Course
The main purpose of the course is to provide students with the qualifications needed to understand the core object-oriented concepts and to implement smaller programs in Java from UML class diagrams.

# Skills and Competences
 The student should be able to:

- Construct Java programs with proper choice of selection and loop structures.
- Create and use objects in Java.
- Implement classes in Java using the object oriented concepts: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
